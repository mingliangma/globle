									ideas by Globle users, the election and employment of project leads and team
									members, the issuance of virtual tokens for project crowdsales, the supervision
									and governance of projects by their investors; and the redistribution of profits to
									project contributors and the Globle community as a whole.

							Globle Coin (GBC) is Globleâ€™s own digital currency, which will be the store of

							only the positive aspects of each.

						<p className="description wow fadeInLeft">
							Globle Coin will be the first digital currency to have a dynamic and varying supply
							of coins that is self-issued by a fully automated smart contract. This will keep its
							value extremely stable, like most fiat currencies we have today (e.g. dollars,
							euros, pounds), and prevent large price fluctuations which are common with
							other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple), mostly due to having
							limited and fixed supplies of coins.
