						Globle Coin (GBC) is Globleâ€™s own digital currency, which will be the store of
						value for all funds and transactions that move through the platform. An asset with
						a unique structure, it is a hybrid between fiat and cryptocurrency, incorporating
						only the positive aspects of each.
					</p>
					<p className="description wow fadeInLeft">
						Globle Coin will be the first digital currency to have a dynamic and varying supply
						of coins that is self-issued by a fully automated smart contract. This will keep its
						value extremely stable, like most fiat currencies we have today (e.g. dollars,
						euros, pounds), and prevent large price fluctuations which are common with
						other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple), mostly due to having
						limited and fixed supplies of coins.
